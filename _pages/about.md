Hi!
------
I'm __Kyle Whitecross__, a first-year PhD Student at the [Manning CICS](https://www.cics.umass.edu/) in [UMass Amherst](https://www.umass.edu).  I work at the [Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval](https://ciir.cs.umass.edu/), where I am advised by Prof. [Negin Rahimi](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~rahimi/).  Previously, I was a B.S. student at [UCLA](ucla.edu) in the [Samueli School of Engineering](https://samueli.ucla.edu/), where I studied Computer Science


Research
------
Currently, I'm interested in leveraging graph machine learning to build more flexible and robust Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) systems.  In the past, I have also worked on designing more expressive Graph Transformers with Prof. [Rex Ying](https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/ying-rex/), compiling neural networks into tractable boolean circuits with Prof. [Adnan Darwiche](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~darwiche/), and studying robustness to noisily labelled data with Prof. [Baharan Mirzasoleiman](https://baharanm.github.io/).  I also interned at [Kumo.ai](https://kumo.ai/) where I developed and deployed a method to automatically identify target leakage in large industry datasets.
